# Example Terminal Backend

This is a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) webapp that you can use to run the Stripe Terminal SDK example apps.

| Platform | Example App |
| - | - |
| iOS | https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-ios |
| JavaScript | https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js |
| Android | Coming Soon |

**Note that backend is intended for example purposes only**. You'll likely want to use something more serious for your app in production.
